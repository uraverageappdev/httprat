# Run these commands in the directory before running

There are some libraries that need to be installed. But, since i don't remember their names, you can download the ```node_modules``` folder, download the folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/147TSpnX1YI2M0738mLGRNawn8fA5bDoh?usp=sharing)

Extract it where there is a main.js

Then you can just ```node main.js```
