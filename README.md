# PRE

There are some libraries that need to be installed. But, since i don't remember their names, you can download the ```node_modules``` folder, download the folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/147TSpnX1YI2M0738mLGRNawn8fA5bDoh?usp=sharing) (it's too large for github)

Extract it where there is a main.js

# To run
```node main.js```
